# PowerBI-EmployeePresenceInsight
This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing employee attendance data from a company named AtilQ.


In this project, our objective is to derive insights from the employee attendance data of a company named Atliq. The data has been sourced from a YouTube channel named Codebasics, and the project serves as a learning experience for Power BI.

Our focus within the project includes identifying trends in employee behaviour, such as the percentage of individuals working from home, the percentage of employees on sick leave, determining the day of the week with the highest employee presence, and pinpointing the day of the month when most employees work from home.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into data-cleaning techniques and the process of consolidating information from multiple Excel sheets.
